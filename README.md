# Text-To-Speech Converter

A lightweight, browser-based application that converts written text into speech using the Web Speech API. This project demonstrates how simple it is to integrate text-to-speech functionality into a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Text-To-Speech Converter provides an intuitive interface where users can input any text and have it spoken aloud. Whether you need accessibility features, language learning support, or simply want to experiment with speech synthesis, this project serves as a great starting point.

Key highlights include:
- **Simple UI:** A clean, minimalistic design for an easy user experience.
- **Real-Time Speech Synthesis:** Converts text to natural-sounding speech using the browserâ€™s built-in capabilities.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Built entirely with front-end technologies, ensuring quick load times and smooth performance.
- **Deployable Anywhere:** The project is deployed using Netlify and can be accessed from any modern web browser.

## Features

- **Input Text Field:** Type or paste text into the input area.
- **Speech Control:** Convert text to speech with a single click.
- **Customizable Voice Options:** Modify voice parameters (e.g., rate, pitch) if desired.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## How It Works

This project leverages the Web Speech API, which is supported by most modern browsers. The key JavaScript functions listen for a button click, capture the text from the input field, and then use the speech synthesis functionality to read the text aloud.
